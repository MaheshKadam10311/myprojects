  </br>
  <ul>
     <li><em><strong>Historical Background:</strong> The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture located in Agra, India. It was commissioned in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth.</em></li>
  </br>
     <li><em><strong>Architectural Marvel:</strong>Designed by a team of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the Taj Mahal is renowned for its symmetrical layout, intricate marble inlay work, and exquisite decorative elements. It seamlessly blends elements of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles.</em></li>
  </br>   
     <li><em><strong>Symbol of Love:</strong> The Taj Mahal is often described as the epitome of love and is considered one of the most romantic buildings in the world. Its construction was a testament to Shah Jahan's love for Mumtaz Mahal, with the mausoleum serving as her final resting place. </em></li>
  </br>
     <li><em><strong>Historical Significance: </strong>Beyond its architectural splendor, the Taj Mahal holds significant historical importance as a symbol of the Mughal Empire's cultural and artistic achievements. It stands as a testament to the wealth, power, and sophistication of the Mughal rulers during their reign.</em></li>
  </br>   
     <li><em><strong>White Marble Beauty:  </strong> The main mausoleum of the Taj Mahal is constructed entirely of white marble, which gives it a luminous appearance that changes with the sunlight throughout the day.
